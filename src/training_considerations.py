Training Considerations for Multi-Task Learning

This module analyzes different training scenarios and their implications:
1. Entire Network Frozen
2. Transformer Backbone Frozen
3. Single Task Head Frozen

Key Components:
1. Freezing Strategies: Different parameter freezing approaches
2. Transfer Learning: Pre-trained model utilization
3. Layer Management: Freezing/unfreezing specific layers
4. Training Analysis: Impact of different strategies

Transfer Learning Approach:
1. Pre-trained Model: BERT-base for strong language understanding
2. Layer Strategy: Gradual unfreezing of higher layers
3. Rationale: Preserve basic language features while adapting to tasks
